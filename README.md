# TDDD23-Design-and-Programming-of-Computer-Games
In this course me and my project partner created a game in Unity. The game is a single player, 2D top-down shooter game with locked view. The goal with the game is to defeat enemies by shooting them with weapons. To shoot an enemy, the colour of the weapon have to match the colour of the enemy.
